    "> **Tip**: In this section of the report, provide a brief introduction to the dataset you've selected for analysis. At the end of this section, describe the questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables.\n",

    ">id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, cast, homepage, director, tagline, keywords, overview, runtime, genres, production_companies, release_date, vote_count, vote_average, release_year, budget_adj, revenue_adj\n",

    "> Will be investingating the IMDB database. Primarily focusing on genres\n",
    "1. Profit vs. popularity to see if the more popular movies ended up making more profit\n",
    "2. (i) Plot popularity rating vs. Genre for a specific year. to see which genres are the most successfull. Assume  popularity \n",
    "     (ii) Plot profit vs. Genre for a specific year\n",
    "     (iii) Table showing this year the ranking for genres is. Assume that profit and popularity are correlated.  Will define success by popularity rating for the rest of the report\n",
    "3. Do this genre ranking for every year. Rank on y axis and year on x axis. Each genre will be a differently  coloured point.\n",
    "4. Pie charts to show trending genres. For each Studio do a pie chart of the genres they produce.\n",
    "5. Can't assume success is based only on the genre of a movie. Analyse over a few years which quarter:\n",
    "(i) had the most movie releases\n",
    "(ii) had the most profit\n",
    "6. Table of directors with highest grossing films\n",
    "7. State how extraneous factors are also involved in the success of a movie. Bad weather, political turmoil etc can stop people from going to the movies. How much advertising was doen and how well received the adverts were etc. However it's difficult to make accurate predictions taking in all of the different factors that could affect a movies success. Make predictions of what the future trends are likely to be based on the data we have analysed.\n"
