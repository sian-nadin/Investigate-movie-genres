# InvestigateADataset
Project 2 of Data analysis nanodegree

For this project, we will conduct data analysis and create a file to share that documents our findings. 
We start by taking a look at a movie dataset and brainstorming what questions we could answer using it. 
The project involves using Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions we posited, and create a report sharing the answers.
